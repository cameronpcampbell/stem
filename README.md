# Stem

A Headless component system (with only minimal styling) for the Roblox ecosystem, designed to work across many UI frameworks (currently supports [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion) and [Vide](https://github.com/centau/vide)).

Stem provides the logic and the brains of the UI and you provide the styling. All components reside directly inside your project instead of in an imported package. This makes it incredibly straight-forward to apply modifications. A CLI is used to add components to your projects:

```
stem add fusion/button vide/button
```
